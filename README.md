# Hi there 👋

## Front End Software Developer

💻 Hello there, I'm Luis! I graduated from Wyncode Academy as a Front End Software Developer in the Miami/Fort-Lauderdale EW. I have a fondness for front-end design and development. I'm currently learning languages and frameworks like React and Express, as well as work in Wordpress. I'm a dedicated team player, self motivated, and I have a passion for learning! 

🌐 As a detail-oriented developer, I believe in the power of clean and maintainable code. I'm dedicated to creating scalable and modular architectures that contribute to the success of the projects I work on.

📚 When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in the latest front-end development blogs, attending tech meetups, and contributing to the open-source community. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
